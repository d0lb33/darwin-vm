# safe_attach.sh - attach and detach disk images without taking the Mac down.
#
# On 2026-09-02 this project kernel-panicked macOS twice, identically:
#
#   panic(cpu N, caller 0x...): "Data ObjId overflow" @jobj.c:1152
#   Panicked task: pid 109: fseventsd
#
# jobj.c is APFS's object-ID allocator and fseventsd is the filesystem-events
# daemon. The images we work with are APFS containers holding ~500,000-file iOS
# filesystems; mounting them exposes that to the host, where Spotlight indexes
# it and fseventsd tracks every change. Combined with mass create/delete churn
# inside the container, APFS exhausted its object-ID space and panicked.
#
# A filesystem should return an error rather than panic, so this is an APFS bug
# (macOS 27.0 beta, 26A5421a) - but we trigger it, and we can avoid it.
#
# This wrapper enforces the rules we learned the hard way:
#   - always -nobrowse, so Finder and friends leave it alone
#   - drop .metadata_never_index at the volume root, so Spotlight skips it
#   - drop .fseventsd/no_log, so fseventsd stops logging events for it; this
#     is the daemon actually named in every host panic, and it ignores both
#     -nobrowse and .metadata_never_index
#   - refuse a second attachment of an image that is already attached; five
#     concurrent read-write attachments once silently corrupted an image
#   - detach by mount point, never a blanket force-detach: the user has other
#     volumes mounted, including Xcode Simulator runtimes, and we clobbered one
#
# usage:
#   safe_attach.sh attach <image> [--readonly] [--owners on|off]
#   safe_attach.sh detach <mountpoint>
#   safe_attach.sh list
