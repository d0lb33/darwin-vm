# Native input development (24A5430a)

Status: helper built and executed in the restore guest; normal-system startup
and actual HID/UI delivery are still under investigation. Do not describe the
helper as a working replacement for the LLDB touch bridge yet.

The user authorized a native iOS helper for this development image. Display
continues to use the existing snapshot and allocation/watchdog accommodations;
removing those display callbacks is deferred.

## Why move touch out of LLDB

The prototype in `tools/re/touch_bridge.py` records the completed gesture and
constructs a native Recap stream one function call at a time. Each debugger
stop pauses every virtual CPU. A shared CF observer also stops unrelated
processes. QEMU `accel/tcg/cpu-exec.c:check_for_breakpoints_slow` forces
single-instruction translation on a breakpoint's page, so callback hit counts
alone understate the cost of leaving such a breakpoint installed.

Read-only QMP samples (`tools/re/runtime_perf_sample.py`):

| Run/sample | Running fraction | Presentations / second |
|---|---:|---:|
| SETUP_TOUCH_R23.perf-broad.json | 78.2% | 0 |
| SETUP_TOUCH_R23.perf-narrow.json | 95.3% | 0 |
| DISPLAY_PERF_R24.no-touch.json | 99.0% | 14.33 |
| DISPLAY_PERF_R24.timer.json | 63.7% | 0 |

All JSON artifacts are under `/tmp/dvm`. These are different guest intervals,
not matched animation benchmarks. Presentations can contain identical pixels.
R23's narrow selector had no hits, so its measurement did not prove working
input. R24 proved that selector can fire and execute idle resets, but it still
causes frequent global stops. No end-to-end latency improvement is established.

R23's saved SpringBoard main stack was inside `CA::Render::Message::send_message`
at static `0x184404fb0` (the call uses MACH_SEND_MSG without a timeout).
R24 later had an ordinary main-run-loop receive wait. A single blocked stack
does not establish a persistent display-server deadlock.

## Proposed native path

QEMU's existing absolute-mouse capture file -> `tools/input/relay.py` -> the
existing UART -> `dvm-input` -> a persistent native Recap virtual HID service.
The relay preserves button edges, coalesces pending motion, and measures ACK
latency. ACK means the helper called the native submission method, not that an
application processed the event. No Apple touch-controller MMIO is invented.

The helper uses runtime symbols and Objective-C selectors, not fixed addresses.
24A5430a native evidence:

- `+[RCPEventSenderProperties touchScreenDigitizerSenderForDisplayUUID:]`,
  `0x29b208234`, provides the same explicit main-display association used by
  the successful LLDB prototype.
- `-[RCPEventDeliveryServicePool deliveryServiceForSenderProperties:]`,
  `0x29b1fc1e8`, obtains and starts the service.
- `-[RCPVirtualHIDService postHIDEvent:]`, `0x29b1fff38`, dispatches through
  HIDVirtualEventService. The helper retains this service between packets.
- Device IOKit exports digitizer/finger constructors at `0x18f009520` and
  `0x18f0094ec`. Home uses native consumer-page usage `0x0c/0x40`, also
  observed in Recap `_createIOSButtonHIDEventWithButtonType:down:`.

The constructor declarations and display-integrated digitizer shape were also
cross-checked against the upstream
[vphoned HID implementation](https://github.com/Lakr233/vphone-cli/blob/main/scripts/vphoned/vphoned_hid.m).
Our path uses Recap's registered virtual service instead of copying its fixed
sender ID. Coordinate mapping and down/move/up delivery still need runtime proof.

## Build, install, and bootstrap evidence

`bash tools/input/build.sh` builds the arm64/iOS executable and adds its exact
CDHash to a derived trust cache. It does not replace the existing system cache.
`python3 tools/input/test_input.py` compiles a host validator that never loads
HID frameworks or submits host events, and checks framing/coalescing.

`prepare_ramdisk.sh` attaches only a new copy of the small restore ramdisk,
through `safe_attach.sh`. `install_in_guest.sh` installs into a writable child
of the migrated System disk inside iOS. No host attachment of the large iOS
System/Data container is needed. The restore image has no umount executable;
sync and stop the owned staging VM before using that child for normal boot.

NATIVE_INPUT_INSTALL1: installed checksum `3310005994`, size 53184;
`/libexec/dvm-input --validate` printed `DVM_INPUT_ACK 1 1` inside iOS.
Evidence: `/tmp/dvm/native-input/install.console.log` and
`/tmp/dvm/probe/NATIVE_INPUT_INSTALL1.serial.log`.

NATIVE_INPUT_BOOT1 uses `/tmp/dvm/native-input/disk.qcow2`, a child of
DISPLAY_SMP6_QEMU_SCANOUT8's migrated disk. It loads the new trust cache at a
fresh six-CPU boot; resolved shared-cache slide is `0x1bc94000`. Early boot
completed at guest 12.90 seconds. The expensive file-attribution migration was
not repeated. The helper was absent from the live process list, so a one-time
native spawn/bootstrap probe is being used. A RunningBoard-context spawn
returned EPERM; the exact denied operation is not yet established. An earlier
BackBoard-context spawn did not return before that process restarted.

`tools/input/bootstrap_helper.py` stages native mmap, file actions and
posix_spawn at a Mach-message return. It writes argument data only, preserves
raw general/SIMD registers and flags, and disables its breakpoint on completion.
Do not reinitialize it during an active call. If its process dies, establish
that fact before clearing its saved state; never restore another thread's
registers from an abandoned call.

Once actual input works, take a new immutable RAM/device/disk checkpoint, then
compare native ACK and visible UI response with the touch breakpoints disabled.
