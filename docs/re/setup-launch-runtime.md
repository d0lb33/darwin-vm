# Setup Assistant launch gate: runtime result (`UI_SETUP_GATE1`)

Run on 2026-09-03 13:06-13:11 with `tools/re/setup_gate_probe.sh UI_SETUP_GATE1`
(persistent-NVMe parent `sks-op09-complete-2.qcow2`, fresh child, `-S`, gdbstub
on 1234, IOMFB level 4 with the D120/D586 callback script).  The raw logs under
`/tmp/dvm` were lost to a host reboot minutes after the run; the values below
were read from `/tmp/dvm/UI_SETUP_GATE1.lldb.log` while it existed and are
recorded here from that reading.  Rerunning the script reproduces them.

## Same-boot slide and callback proof

`tools/re/resolve_live_dsc.py` stopped the guest at runtime PC `0x252353ec4`,
matched its 8 words exactly once in `dyld_shared_cache_arm64e.40` (file offset
`0x78cfec4`, static PC `0x237ccfec4`), giving slide **`0x1a684000`**, runtime
cache base `0x19a684000`, `gva2gpa 0x100005d0000`.  This differs from both
earlier boots (`0x9b98000`, `0x1dcf4000`), as expected.

All 15 breakpoints were installed with `breakpoint command add -F
setup_gate_callbacks.on_break` and each printed a `COMMAND_LIST_PROOF` block
showing the Python callback (the `-o ... -o continue` trap in
`docs/re/lldb-breakpoint-command-trap.md` is avoided).  The callbacks are
bounded multi-hit (16 or 32) and are never disabled on first hit.

The guest reached `Early boot complete` (serial line 641), 0 `panic(cpu`, 0
`Copying`, 1,246 serial lines at freeze; the screendump at freeze was 1179x2556
with a single pixel value (black).

## What the 193 hits prove

| Site (static) | Hits | Value |
|---|---:|---|
| `0x1cac11c18` `_BYSetupAssistantNeedsToRun` entry | 16 (then bounded off) | callers below |
| `0x1cac11c44` non-UI predicate | 16 | `w0 = 0` every time (passes) |
| `0x1cac11ca0` `ForceNoBuddy` | 16 | `w20 = 0` every time (passes) |
| `0x1cac11fc8` after `_MGGetSInt32Answer(DeviceClassNumber)` | 16 | **`w0 = 1`** every time |
| `0x1cac11d20`/`d28` cached `isSupported` byte | 16 | `01` after the first evaluation (`00` before it, once token 0) |
| `0x1cac11d30` after `_LaunchSentinelExists` | 16 | `w0 = 0`: `sem_open("purplebuddy.sentinel", 0)` returned -1, sentinel absent |
| `0x1cac11d44` internal-content check | 16 | `w0 = 0`, so the function returns `w20 = !sentinel = 1` directly |
| `0x1cac11cf0` return | 32 | **`w0 = 1` in all 32** |
| `0x1cac11df4` unsupported-device edge | 0 | never taken |
| `0x1cac23394` `_BYSetupAssistantPrepareLaunchSentinel` | 0 | never called |
| `0x224c4fb78` SpringBoard `_SBWorkspaceActivateApplication` (bricked path) | 0 | never called in 300 s |
| `0x1af732264` MobileGestalt helper | 1 | `w21 = 0x16`; a different caller, not SetupAssistant's query |

So the hypothesis in `docs/re/setup-launch-gate.md` is refuted: **the device-class
gate passes** (`DeviceClassNumber = 1`, in `{1,2,3,4,7}`) and
`BYSetupAssistantNeedsToRun()` answers **YES** to every process that asks.

## Who asked, and who did not

The 16 entry hits came from 8 distinct threads (distinct `tpidr_el1`), 7 of
them main threads (`sp` in `0x16b..0x16e`) each calling twice from two return
addresses whose page offsets are identical across processes
(`...e9d8` then `...eac4`, e.g. `0x1013fe9d8`/`0x1013feac4`,
`0x102a569d8`/`0x102a56ac4`, `0x1045b29d8`/`0x1045b2ac4`, ...), i.e. one
non-cache image mapped at a different slide in each process; the eighth
(`lr 0x103887fa8`, `sp 0x106c86890`) is a different image on a secondary
thread.  All `lr` values were outside the shared cache.  None of the 16 came
from SpringBoard's own call site `0x2246d386c` (`-[SBSetupManager
updateInSetupMode]`, below), but the entry breakpoint was bounded off after 16
hits while the return breakpoint went on to 32, so SpringBoard's evaluation is
**not excluded**, only unobserved.  The next run records `__progname` per hit
(`**(slide + 0x1e6ef1590)`, libsystem_c `___progname_pointer`, read by
`__NSGetProgname` at `0x187f00bb4`) to name the callers.

## SpringBoard's launch logic (static, iOS 27 b8 cache)

`-[SBSetupManager updateInSetupMode]` (`0x2246d37f0`):

```
if ([lockdownManager isInLostMode] && [self hasPasscodeSet]) -> reason 0
else if ([x30 isMultiUserSupported] && [x30 isLoginSession]) -> reason 0
else if (BYSetupAssistantNeedsToRun())            -> reason 1   (0x2246d3868)
else if ([x20 brickedDevice])                       -> reason 2
else if (self->_migrating /*+0x41*/ == 1)          -> reason 3
else                                                -> reason 0
[self _setSetupRequiredReason:reason]               (0x228095e60)
```

Log strings: "inSetupMode = YES because BYSetupAssistantNeedsToRun() returned
YES" at `0x224e1624c`; the selector names come from the `objc_msgSend$` stubs
at `0x2280be090` (`isInLostMode`), `0x228071d80` (`hasPasscodeSet`),
`0x2280be8e0` (`isMultiUserSupported`), `0x2280be670` (`isLoginSession`),
`0x2280a5440` (`brickedDevice`).

`-[SBLockScreenManager _maybeLaunchSetupForcingCheckIfNotBricked:]`
(`0x224c4f7bc`): the block at `0x224c4faf8` that calls
`_SBWorkspaceActivateApplication([setupManager setupApplication])` runs only if
`[[self lockdownManager] brickedDevice]` is true, or if the BOOL argument is
set and `[setupManager updateInSetupMode]` returns nonzero.  Its log string is
"Activating Setup because we think we're bricked." (`0x224e5801a`).  This is
the bricked-device path, not the ordinary first-boot path, so its silence is
expected; the ordinary path goes through `_setSetupRequiredReason:` and was not
yet instrumented.

## Open questions

| Question | Observation that settles it |
|---|---|
| Does SpringBoard evaluate `updateInSetupMode` at all, and with which reason? | hits at `0x2246d37f0` (entry) and `0x2246d395c` (`x2` = reason) in a run where the entry breakpoint is not bounded off before SpringBoard runs |
| After reason 1, which code activates `Setup.app`? | callers of `_setSetupRequiredReason:` consumers; `SBWorkspaceActivateApplication` call sites in SpringBoard other than the bricked block |
| Which 7 processes call the gate twice from the same image? | `__progname` per hit in the next run |

## SpringBoard's ordinary launch path (static, from the full framework dump)

`ipsw dyld disass --image SpringBoard.framework/SpringBoard --quiet` plus
`a2s` on every `bl` to the `objc_msgSend$updateInSetupMode` stub
(`0x2280ea450`) and to `_SBWorkspaceActivateApplication` (`0x22433ff18`):

| Site | Function | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `0x2244d2748` | `-[SpringBoard applicationDidFinishLaunching:]` +7076 (entry `0x2244d0ba4`) | first `updateInSetupMode` |
| `0x2244d8dfc` | `-[SpringBoard _finalizeStartupAfterScenesDidConnect:]` +264 (entry `0x2244d8cf4`) | `updateInSetupMode` once UIKit scenes are connected |
| `0x2244783ac` | `-[SBMainWorkspace _selectTransactionForReturningToTheLockScreenAndForceToBuddy:]` block (`0x22447835c`; method `0x224478298`) | launches Setup if `[setupManager isInSetupMode]` (`0x2244783a0`) and `updateInSetupMode` bit 0, or if the block's `forceToBuddy` byte (+0x28) is 1; otherwise the lock-screen path at `0x224478414` |
| `0x2244783d0` | same block | `[applicationController applicationWithBundleIdentifier:SBBuddyBundleIdentifier]`; nil here means LaunchServices has no `com.apple.purplebuddy` |
| `0x2242e48cc`, `0x2242e4a58`, `0x2242e4a64` | `-[SBToAppsWorkspaceTransaction _didComplete]` (entry `0x2242e47ec`) | `updateInSetupMode`, `setupApplication`, `_SBWorkspaceActivateApplication` |
| `0x2243045ac` | `__SBWorkspaceCanLaunchApplication` +384 (entry `0x22430442c`) | launch gating |
| `0x224312da8` | `-[SBMainWorkspace _validateRequestToOpenApplication:options:origin:error:]` +556 | launch gating |
| `0x224479474` | `-[SBMainWorkspace _handleSetupExited:]` +44 (entry `0x224479448`) | fires only after Setup ran and exited |
| `0x2243bf920` | `-[SBApplicationController setupApplication]` | tail call to `applicationWithBundleIdentifier:` with `SBBuddyBundleIdentifier` (`0x268990448`) |
| `0x2246d3adc` | `-[SBSetupManager _setSetupRequiredReason:]` | stores the reason at +0x38, compares `isInSetupMode` before/after, notifies the delegate (+0x8) and posts a notification; logs "Setup mode state did change - required reason: %@" |

So the first-boot launch is not a direct consequence of
`BYSetupAssistantNeedsToRun`: SpringBoard must (1) reach
`_finalizeStartupAfterScenesDidConnect:`, which needs its UIKit scenes
connected (a FrontBoard/backboardd display dependency), (2) have
`updateInSetupMode` report reason 1, and (3) resolve `com.apple.purplebuddy`
through `SBApplicationController`.  `tools/re/sb_setup_path_callbacks.py`
breaks on every one of those edges with the process name per hit
(`CALLBACKS=sb_setup_path_callbacks tools/re/setup_gate_probe.sh <TAG>`).

## Phase 2 (`UI_SB_SETUP_PATH1`, rebuilt parent): SpringBoard never starts its app

Run 13:37-13:43 with `CALLBACKS=sb_setup_path_callbacks`, slide `0x15080000`,
32 breakpoints with proofs, 169 hits, every hit named by `__progname`
(`~/dvm-artifacts/probe-logs/UI_SB_SETUP_PATH1.lldb.log`).  Parent:
`/tmp/dvm/data-seed/rebuild/boot2.qcow2` from
`tools/rootfs/rebuild_persistent_parent.sh` after the host reboot.

| Observation | Value |
|---|---|
| `_BYSetupAssistantNeedsToRun` callers | `bluetoothd` x47, `audioaccessoryd` x5, `coreauthd` x3, `cloudd` x2, `deviceaccessd` x2, `CommCenter` x1; **the phase-1 "7 processes at 7 slides" was `bluetoothd` relaunching** (its `__TEXT` is >4 MB, matching `lr` offsets `+0x3fe9d8`/`+0x3feac4`) |
| SpringBoard | **zero** hits at `applicationDidFinishLaunching:`, `_finalizeStartupAfterScenesDidConnect:`, `updateInSetupMode`, the ForceToBuddy block, `_SBWorkspaceActivateApplication`, `_handleSetupExited:` in 360 s |
| `abort()` | `callservicesd` and `chronod`, both from static `0x1844e4eb0` in QuartzCore `query_displays()` |
| serial | 1,177 lines, 0 `panic(cpu`, 0 critical-process reboots; screendump black |

So Setup's own gate is irrelevant: SpringBoard never gets as far as its app
delegate.  The abort site explains why UIKit clients die and points at the
render server.

### The display query is refused out of process

`query_displays()` (`0x1844e47c8`) loops for 5 s: `CARenderServerGetServerPort`
(`0x1844e4834`), `_CASGetDisplays` (`0x1844e4848`, return code in `w19` at
`0x1844e484c`); `w19 == 0xfb294002` or `-0x134` (`MIG_SERVER_DIED`) sleeps
500 ms and retries; any other nonzero code, or the deadline, reaches
`0x1844e4e54`, logs "CoreAnimation: Unable to query displays from server (%d)"
(`0x184837336`) and calls `abort()` at `0x1844e4eb0`.

Server side, `__XGetDisplays` (`0x18440c4f0`) loads
`CA::Render::Server::_oop_display_observation_disabled` (`0x1e40102a6`) at
`0x18440c560`; if it is 1 and the requester pid (`w21`, request +0x4c) differs
from `getpid()` (`0x18440c56c-0x574`), the reply code is `0xfb294002`
(`0x18440c6d0-0x6dc`).  backboardd creates its window server with exactly that
flag: `backboardd:0x1000258c8-0x100025918` builds
`{kCAWindowServerDisableUpdatesOnMainDisplay: YES,
kCAWindowServerDisableOutOfProcessDisplayObservation: YES}` and calls
`+[CAWindowServer serverWithOptions:]` unconditionally.  The flag is cleared
only by `-[CAWindowServer enableOutOfProcessDisplayObservation]`
(`0x1847574ec`: `stlrb wzr` then `notify_post
"com.apple.CoreAnimation.CAWindowServer.DisplayChanged"`), reachable via
`_CARenderServerEnableOutOfProcessDisplayObservation` (`0x1846d7828`) or the
MIG request `__XEnableOutOfProcessDisplayObservation` (`0x1847da7dc`).
backboardd's own binary contains the selector string, so on real hardware
backboardd re-enables observation itself once its display setup finishes;
here that never happens within 360 s, and every out-of-process CoreAnimation
client that asks for displays aborts 5 s later.  Phase 3
(`tools/re/display_query_callbacks.py`) records who asks, what the server
answers, whether any enable path runs, and backboardd's StartWindowServer
gate outcome.

### backboardd enables observation only on the setup-complete path

`backboardd:0x100025ef0` (`ipsw macho disass` of the extracted binary, text
`0x100001fe0-0x10005aa44`) asks `+[CAWindowServer serverIfRunning]`, logs
"StartWindowServer: enabling out of process display observation"
(`0x100083f6c`), calls `-[CAWindowServer enableOutOfProcessDisplayObservation]`
at `0x100025f48`, and then logs "StartWindowServer: Setup complete"
(`0x100083fab`, `0x100025f74`).  The headless branch selected by the null
tests at `0x1000259fc`/`0x100025a00` (`docs/re/backboardd-start-window-server-gate.md`)
never reaches `0x100025f48`.  Therefore, on this guest, either the null tests
took the headless branch or StartWindowServer never ran; either way
`_oop_display_observation_disabled` stays 1 and every UIKit process aborts in
`query_displays()`.  `tools/re/display_query_callbacks.py` breaks on the
cache-side enable method and, once backboardd's PIE base is resolved from a
live frame, on `B+0x259fc`, `B+0x25a00`, `B+0x25fdc`, `B+0x25ef0`,
`B+0x25f48` and `B+0x25f74`.

## Phase 3 (`UI_DISPLAY_QUERY1`): the render server answers once, then never again

`CALLBACKS=display_query_callbacks`, slide `0xd72c000`, 21 breakpoints with
proofs, log in `~/dvm-artifacts/probe-logs/UI_DISPLAY_QUERY1.lldb.log`.  Times
are seconds after backboardd's first `query_displays` (13:47:34 host).

| t | process | event |
|---:|---|---|
| 0.0 | backboardd | `query_displays` from its own StartWindowServer path; server port `0x7103` found at 1.4 s |
| 8.3 | chronod | `query_displays`, port found |
| 47.7 | callservicesd | `query_displays`, port found |
| 102.2 | backboardd (server thread) | first `__XGetDisplays` ever serviced: own pid `0x47` accepted, six `Server::get_displays` calls; then chronod (`0x72`) and callservicesd (`0x7d`) refused with `0xfb294002` |
| 102.2 | backboardd | its own `_CASGetDisplays` returns 0 with a 543-byte display list |
| 102.3 | chronod, callservicesd | reply arrives long after their 5 s deadline: error edge `0x1844e4e54`, then `abort()` |
| 102.8 | backboardd | `-[CAWindowServer enableOutOfProcessDisplayObservation]` from `backboardd+0x25f4c`, the setup-complete path |
| 103.2 | **SpringBoard** | `query_displays` (via `+[CADisplay mainDisplay]` `0x1843e33b8`), port `0x510b` found |
| 107.2 / 110.9 / 120.5 | chronod, com.apple.datamigrator, callservicesd | relaunched, `query_displays` again, ports found |
| 112.9 | AccessibilityUIServer | `_UIApplicationMain` |
| to 230+ | — | **no `_CASGetDisplays` return and no server-side `__XGetDisplays` for any of them** |

So backboardd does complete StartWindowServer (headless path not taken) and
does enable out-of-process observation, but its render-server thread
serviced the MIG port exactly once, about 100 s after the server was created,
and after that no `GetDisplays` request is received.  SpringBoard's
`_CASGetDisplays` is a reply-wait with no timeout, so SpringBoard sits in
`+[CADisplay mainDisplay]` forever, never reaches `_UIApplicationMain`, and
Setup is never launched.  This is the first-order gate for any UI, ahead of
every SpringBoard/Setup decision above.

Two things still to establish: what the render-server thread blocks on
between and after those bursts (the ~100 s delay and the permanent stall have
the same shape: the thread that owns the MIG port is busy in display
initialisation/rendering, most likely an IOMobileFramebuffer wait on the DCP),
and whether the client refusal window matters once the stall is fixed (the
5 s deadline versus a 100 s server startup would still kill every early
client).

## Phase 4 (`UI_DISPLAY_STALL1`): the server thread is idle in `mach_msg`, and messages arrive in bursts

`CALLBACKS=display_stall_callbacks`, slide `0x1026c000`, 23 breakpoints with
proofs (`~/dvm-artifacts/probe-logs/UI_DISPLAY_STALL1.lldb.log`).  The
render-server thread's `mach_msg` return at `server_thread+0x1a0`
(`0x1843f9804`) was used as a heartbeat; entry/return of every swap and wait
routine was watched by planting a one-shot breakpoint at the caller's `lr`.

| t (host s) | event |
|---:|---|
| 0.0 | backboardd (a dispatch thread, not StartWindowServer) enters `query_displays` |
| 3.6 | `CA::Render::Server::server_thread` starts, locks `_mutex`, broadcasts, enters the blocking `mach_msg` receive on its port (`options 0x0300080e`, no timeout) |
| 9.1, 56.6 | chronod, callservicesd send `_CASGetDisplays` |
| 73.6 | **two** messages received, nothing else |
| 105.1-105.4 | **54 messages received in 300 ms**: 20 `render_for_time` calls (2-5 ms each), then the six `Server::get_displays` and the three queued `GetDisplays` requests |
| 106.1 | backboardd enables out-of-process observation (StartWindowServer completes) |
| 106.7 | SpringBoard sends `_CASGetDisplays` |
| 106-356 | 4 more receives at 106 s, then none; SpringBoard never answered; no swap, vsync, relbuf, or timer breakpoint ever fired |

No `IOMFBDisplay::swap_wait`, `kern_SwapWait`, `wait_for_relbuf_info`,
`vsync_callback`, `add_vsync_source` or `IOMFBServer::timer_callback` hit in
356 s, and the DCP trace shows only 48 AP-to-DCP RPCs (`A030` x14 the most
frequent) and two callbacks, so neither QuartzCore nor the DCP model is busy.
The server thread spends the whole run blocked in a receive while messages
that were sent 60-100 s earlier sit undelivered, then arrive together.  That
is not display behaviour; it is Mach IPC delivery or thread scheduling in the
guest, i.e. timer/scheduler health on the single TCG vCPU.  The launchd
timestamps in the same run show guest time at 194 s when the host had spent
about 340 s, but every debugger stop pauses the virtual clock, so that ratio
is measured separately by `tools/clock_test.sh` on a debugger-free restore
boot (`sleep N` timed from the host, `date +%s` deltas).

### Clock, timers and CPU profile are not the cause

`tools/clock_test.sh`/manual timing on the restore-ramdisk shell (`CLOCKTEST2`,
no debugger): guest `date +%s` advanced 45 s while the host advanced 44.7 s;
`sleep 10` and `sleep 30` returned after 8.4 s and 28.7 s host (the send
latency is inside those numbers).  The guest counter runs at
`clock-frequency = 0x100000` from the device tree (`dt_fixup.py`, `darwin.c:284`),
and QEMU scales it to real time; the 194 s versus 340 s discrepancy seen under
the debugger is the virtual clock pausing at every breakpoint stop.

`tools/re/sampled_boot.sh PCSAMPLE1` (`tools/pc_sampler.py`, 666 samples at
0.4 s over 270 s, no debugger) shows a uniformly busy vCPU: about 65 % of
samples in the kernel and 35 % in shared-cache user code in every 30-s bucket,
none in the idle/WFI path.  The hottest kernel windows are the timebase read
(`com.apple.kernel+0xb4380`, `+0x212d80`, `+0x213080`, the
`cpu_data->base_timebase` / `S3_4_C15_C10_6` retry loop), the context-switch
accounting loop (`+0xaf800`), the EL0 synchronous vector (`+0x400`, syscalls)
and SPTM at `0xfffffff00709a600`/`0xfffffff0070d4e80` (about 7 %).  There is
no single spin loop and no poll storm on the DCP side (48 RPCs in 356 s), so
the render server's 100-s receive blackout is not CPU starvation and not a
timer fault; once woken, the thread drains 54 messages in 300 ms.

## Phase 5 (`UI_DISPLAY_PORT1`): the service port is only received on once

`CALLBACKS=display_port_callbacks`, slide `0xb5ac000`
(`~/dvm-artifacts/probe-logs/UI_DISPLAY_PORT1.lldb.log`).  The heartbeat now
decodes each received message's header at `sp+0x50`; ids are mapped with
`tools/re/carender_mig_ids.json` (the `_CASCARenderServices_subsystem` at
`0x1e905b680` spans ids 40200-40298; `__XGetDisplays` is 40213).

| t | event |
|---:|---|
| 10.4, 12.6 | backboardd `bootstrap_check_in` from IOMobileFramebuffer framework code (`0x22a372014`, `0x22a3720c8`), not CoreAnimation |
| 12.9 | backboardd dispatch thread enters `query_displays` and blocks in `_CASGetDisplays` |
| 15.8 | `CA::Render::Server::server_thread` starts, receives nothing |
| 84.6 | first `CA::Render::Server::server_port()` call, main thread, from `Server::add_callback` ← `Display::end_display_changes` ← `IOMFBDisplay::update_framebuffer_locked` ← `AppleDisplay::AppleDisplay` ← `AppleInternalDisplay::open` block ← `-[CAWindowServer _detectDisplays]` ← `shared_server_init` ← `+[CAWindowServer serverWithOptions:]`; first receives: 24 messages id 40001 on port `0x8b33`, 15 messages id 0 on `0x11413` (internal, not the client subsystem) |
| 115.8-116.1 | ten more `server_port()` calls; `Server::set_display_state(off)` and `IOMFBDisplay::set_power_state_locked(0)` for five display slots, `complete_display_state_transition(1)` for the main one; **the three queued `__XGetDisplays` (backboardd, chronod, callservicesd) plus six `__XGetDisplayInfo`, `__XRegisterClient`, `__XGetNeededAlignment`, `__XGetMaxRenderableIOSurfaceSize` arrive on service port `0x660b`** |
| 116.6 | `enableOutOfProcessDisplayObservation`; one final message (id 40002 on `0x17d03`) |
| 117.0, 121.8, 129.5, 136.2 | SpringBoard, chronod, datamigrator, callservicesd send `_CASGetDisplays`; **none is ever received**; a `render_for_time` returns at 124.5 s |

So the service port becomes receivable exactly once, during the display's
first state transition, and after `enableOutOfProcessDisplayObservation` no
client message reaches the server thread again.  The chain that takes 100 s
is `serverWithOptions:` → `_detectDisplays` → `AppleInternalDisplay::open`
(reaching the `AppleDisplay` constructor at 84.6 s) → the state transitions at
115.8 s.  Phase 6 (`tools/re/display_open_callbacks.py`) times each link of
that chain, counts port-set insert/move/extract for backboardd only, and
stamps the DCP trace and serial log with host time (`tools/re/stamp_growth.sh`).

## Phase 6 (`UI_DISPLAY_OPEN1`): the chain is slow, then the server thread parks in a condition wait

`CALLBACKS=display_open_callbacks`, slide `0x17330000`, times relative to
backboardd's first `bootstrap_check_in`
(`~/dvm-artifacts/probe-logs/UI_DISPLAY_OPEN1.lldb.log`; entry/return watches).

| t | event |
|---:|---|
| 4.2 | `+[CAWindowServer serverWithOptions:]` → `shared_server_init` (4 ms) → server thread starts → `-[CAWindowServer _detectDisplays]` enters |
| 34.9 | `AppleInternalDisplay::open` enters; `AppleDisplay` constructor enters; `IOMobileFramebufferOpen` takes **21 ms** |
| 68.0 | `IOMFBDisplay::update_framebuffer_locked` → `Display::end_display_changes` → first `server_port()` → `mach_port_move_member`; constructor returns after **33.2 s**; `open` returns |
| 99.5 | five more `AppleDisplay` constructions (fast), `initialize_timings` x7, `set_display_state`, power state, `complete_state_transition`; `_detectDisplays` and `serverWithOptions:` return after **95.6 s**; service port `0xa903` moved into port set `0x8313` at 99.8 s and never removed |
| 99.8 | the three queued `_CASGetDisplays` are answered; 50 receives in that second, 4 more at 100 s, none after |
| 100.8 | SpringBoard `query_displays`; never answered |

`IOMobileFramebufferGetMainDisplay` took 22-86 s in every process that called
it (thermalmonitord 30.7 s, MobileGestaltHelper 22.0 s and 32.9 s,
IOMFB_FDR_Loader 86.1 s): it is `mfb_populate_all_display_infos`, a walk of
every `IODeviceTree:/arm-io` child through `IORegistryEntryGetChildIterator`
and `IORegistryEntrySearchCFProperty`, hundreds of MIG calls, on a vCPU that
`tools/pc_sampler.py` showed saturated.  So the three ~30-s spans are the
same walk done three times (before `open`, inside the constructor, and for
the remaining displays), i.e. TCG throughput, not a timeout.

**The blocker is what the server thread does after the burst.**  With the
guest frozen, `tools/re/kthread_peek.py 0xffffffe483d9f060` (the server
thread's `tpidr_el1`) shows its continuation at `+0xe0` is
`com.apple.kec.pthread+0x2e0c` (`0xfffffff0084067ac` unslid), a `psynch`
continuation, not the IPC receive continuation (`com.apple.kernel+0x2e658`,
which codex's snapshot attributed to `mach_msg` waits).  Its wait queue
(`thread+0x108` → `0xffffffe484595b90`) carries user addresses
`0x7cd4d503b0`, `+0x18`, `+0x20`, `+0x27`: a heap `pthread_cond_t`.  The
render-server thread is therefore blocked in `pthread_cond_wait` on a
heap-allocated condition variable, which is why no later client message is
ever received.  Phase 7 catches that wait from user space with a backtrace to
name the condition and what should signal it.

## Phase 7 (`UI_DISPLAY_WAIT2`): the parked wait is a mutex inside `IOMFBServer::set_next_update`

`CALLBACKS=display_wait_callbacks`, slide `0x8d74000`
(`~/dvm-artifacts/probe-logs/UI_DISPLAY_WAIT2.lldb.log`).  The server thread's
`tpidr_el1` (`0xffffffe94f0c0950`) was recorded at `server_thread` entry and
only that thread's `pthread_cond_wait` / `pthread_cond_timedwait` /
`__psynch_mutexwait` entries were reported.  (A first attempt with a
`pthread_mutex_lock` breakpoint stopped the vCPU on every process's lock
call and crawled; that breakpoint was dropped.)

| t | wait | object | backtrace (static) |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 2.8 | `__psynch_mutexwait` | `CA::Render::Server::_mutex` (`0x1e400a8e8`) | the startup handshake in `server_thread+0xa8`; returns |
| 64, 95 | 2 + 45 `mach_msg` receives | | the burst (queued client requests) |
| 95.5 | `__psynch_mutexwait` | heap `0x78eecad8b0` | `IOMFBServer::set_next_update+60` ← `Server::display_changed+124` ← `post_notification` ← `Display::post_display_changed_callback+124` ← `server_thread+0x1060`; returns |
| 96.1 | **`__psynch_mutexwait`** | **heap `0x78eecac3b0`** (`x1 = 0x20000000302`, owned by another thread) | `IOMFBServer::set_next_update+60` ← `Server::context_changed+0x114` ← `post_notification+788` ← `context_changed` ← `CmdStreamMsg::run` (`0x184406288`, `0x184405c60`) ← `0x184594860` ← `server_thread+0xdf4`; **never returns** |
| 96.2 | | | main thread enables out-of-process observation; SpringBoard queries at 96.5 s; no further receives |

So the render-server thread dies while handling the first client command
stream: `Server::context_changed` posts a notification, `IOMFBServer::set_next_update` tries to take the IOMFB server's mutex, and the owner never
releases it.  `pthread_cond_wait` releases its mutex while sleeping, so the
owner is not in a condition wait; it is either computing or, far more
likely on this model, inside an IOMobileFramebuffer kernel call that never
completes (the phase-4 candidates `IOMFBDisplay::swap_wait`,
`IOMobileFramebufferSwapWait`, `wait_for_relbuf_info` were not hit, so the
call is a different selector).  Phase 8 (`tools/re/display_iokit_callbacks.py`)
records every `IOConnectCall*` backboardd makes with its selector and a
return watch; the entry without a return is the missing DCP completion.

## Phase 8 (`UI_DISPLAY_IOKIT1`): the holder is blocked in `IOMobileFramebuffer` selector 79, `GetBlock`

`CALLBACKS=display_iokit_callbacks`, slide `0xd038000`
(`~/dvm-artifacts/probe-logs/UI_DISPLAY_IOKIT1.lldb.log`).  Every
`IOConnectCall*` made by backboardd was recorded with its selector (x1) and a
return watch; `tools/re/iomfb_selectors.json` maps selectors to the
framework's `_kern_*` wrappers (built from `mov w1, #N` before each
`IOConnectCall*` in the IOMobileFramebuffer framework).  The render-server
thread (`0xffffffe9dc72b060`) blocked on `IOMFBServer+0x3b0` at 103.6 s as in
phase 7.  At that moment exactly one backboardd IOKit call had entered
without returning:

| thread | call | selector | entered |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| `...9220c0` | `IOConnectCallMethod` | **79 = `_kern_GetBlock`** | 103.5 s, never returns |

The same thread had just completed selector 25 (`GetDigitalOutState`) and
12 (`DisplayResourcesValidateAllocation`).  Every other call in the run
returned within milliseconds (`OpenByName` 88, `ValidateAllocation` 12 across
seven threads, `AllocationGetV2` 13).  So the display-attach path holds the
IOMFB server mutex while `GetBlock` sleeps in the kernel waiting for data the
DCP model never produces; the render server then deadlocks on that mutex the
first time a client context changes, and every later CoreAnimation client
(SpringBoard included) blocks forever in `_CASGetDisplays`.

The unreturned call's chain (static symbols of the recorded backtrace):
`CFRunLoop block` ← `Server::render_for_time+19312` ←
`IOMFBServer::complete_display_state_transition` (takes `+0x3b0`) ←
`IOMFBDisplay::complete_display_state_transition` ←
`IOMFBDisplay::update_power_state_locked+1088` ←
`IOMFBDisplay::fetch_current_iomfb_mode+208` ←
`CA::IOMobileFramebuffer::get_digital_mode` block (under `BMBlockMonitoring`) ←
`IOMobileFramebufferGetDigitalOutMode+92` ← `IOConnectCallMethod` selector 79.
`GetDigitalOutMode` (`IOMobileFramebuffer:0x22a396868`) requests block kind
**`0x41`** with a `0x2c`-byte result through `_kern_GetBlock`.  The earlier
three `GetBlock` calls from the `AppleDisplay` constructor (kinds `0x4c`,
`0x4a`, `0x79`, see `docs/re/iomfb-a442-payload-consumers.md`) each produced
one `A442` RPC and returned; **the kind-`0x41` call produces no `A442` at
all** (the run's DCP trace has exactly three `A442`s, `#25-#27`), so the
kernel handler sleeps before issuing anything, i.e. on display state that
the DCP is expected to have reported first: the hot-plug / digital-out latch
in `docs/re/iomfb-hotplug-swap-gate.md`.

### The kernel wait: `iomfb_dcp_power_async`, armed by `A500`

The holder's kernel stack (read from its `thread->kernel_stack` at `+0xf0`,
`0xffffffdf5b020000`, with `tools/re/kc_text_map.py`) runs MIG →
`is_io_connect_method` (`kernel+0x1c4df4`) → external-method dispatch
(`+0x82f3a8`, `+0x82f100`) → `IOMobileFramebufferAP::get_block`
(`IOMFB+0x58a0`) → the `A442` wrapper (`IOMFB+0x18b40`) → `IOMFB+0x22af4`,
`+0x23c7c`, `+0x23abc` → `kernel+0x781940` (`bl 0xfffffff00aaf9ca8`, the
`IOLockSleep` primitive) → scheduler.  `IOMFB+0x23c7c` is the return from the
wait loop at `0xfffffff00a0d5524`:

```
IOLockLock([obj+0x78]);
while ([obj+0x30] == NULL) IOLockSleep([obj+0x78], obj+0x30, interruptible=1);
IOLockUnlock([obj+0x78]);
return [obj+0x30] ? 0 : kIOReturnNotReady (0xe00002c0);
```

The object is constructed at `0xfffffff00a0d5354`, which logs the string
`iomfb_dcp_power_async` (`0xfffffff007992f89`), and its `+0x30` is cleared at
teardown (`0xfffffff00a0d55ec`).  So the kind-`0x41` block fetch waits until an
asynchronous DCP power transition has completed.  That transition is what the
AP asked for with `A500`: the wrapper at `0xfffffff00a0d41f0` is
`A500(u8, u8)` (two bytes plus the `0xaaaa` poison, 4 in / 0 out; the
observed input `00 01 aa aa` is state 0 with the async flag set), the last
RPC the AP ever issues, immediately after `Server::set_display_state(off)`.
On hardware the DCP answers the async power request with a callback that
fills `+0x30`; our model completes `A500` with status 0 and nothing else, so
the waiter never wakes, `complete_display_state_transition` keeps
`IOMFBServer+0x3b0`, and the render server deadlocks on it.

### Correction: the wait is a lock, and the lock traces to RTBuddy's TraceKit endpoint

The section above stopped one level short.  Reading the sleeping object live
(`tools/re/kmem.py`, HMP `x/gx` with the vCPU caught at EL1) shows its `+0x30` is
**already filled** with the matched `AppleDCPExpert` (`0xffffffe8f6017000`), so the
match wait passes.  The deepest IOMFB frame, `0xfffffff00a0d5b3c`, is the return from
`IORecursiveLockLock([obj+0x80])` inside `set_device_power(on)` (`0xa0d5b14`), and the
lock's owner field (`IORecursiveLock+0x18`) names another thread.  Walking that
thread's frame chain (`kmem.py fpwalk`) gives the whole story, every frame confirmed
by the words under its saved `x29`:

| frame | where | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| IOMFB work loop | `0xa0eb5e4` ← `0xa0ee6b4` ← `0xa0c6cb4` (`"fPendingPower_on_internal started"`) | the display-off job |
| `0xa0c6fac` → `0xa0d5cfc` → `0xa0d5bd0` | `power_gated` → `set_device_power(on = 0)` | `x20 = 0` in the frame |
| `AppleDCP+0x5ce8` → `+0x734c` → `+0x5628` → `+0x56c0` → `+0x5830` | `setPowerAssertion(0)` → gated action → `_changeDCPPowerStateInternal(0)`, current state 4 | `x19 = 0`, `x20 = 4` |
| `RTBuddy+0x180d8` → `+0x181a0` → `+0x186c8` | `RTBuddy::setPowerState(0)` → gated body → `_setPowerStateGuardEntryGated` | sleeps while `RTBuddy+0x15c` (`_powerStateChangeLocked`) is set |

`_powerStateChangeLocked` is set only by the guard entry (`0xa7bd644`) and cleared only
by `_setPowerStateGuardExitGated` (`0xa7bdab8`), so a transition was still in flight.  A
physical scan of guest RAM for stack slots holding RTBuddy return addresses
(`tools/re/ramscan_frames.py`; kernel stacks are single 16 KiB pages, so no VA
translation is needed) found it: page `0x1001be28000`, **`RTBuddy(DCP)::start` →
`setPowerState(1)`** (`this = 0xffffffe8f601a000`, role `DCP`, ordinal 1), past the
guard, inside `_setPowerStatePerformChangeGated` → client callback → 
`RTBuddyTraceKitEndpoint::_waitForOutstandingRequestsGated` (`0xa7df68c`), sleeping on
the endpoint's outstanding-request counter at `+0xbc`, which read 1.  A second thread
(`tools/re/ramscan_threads.py`, matching `struct thread` by its constant words at
`+0x1a0`/`+0x1d0`/`+0x1d8`) waits on the same object's `+0xac`: the busy-ACK wait of
`_configureGated` (`0xa7e0738`).  `RTBuddy(ANS2)` is parked identically.

So the DCP's **boot-time power-on never finished**: the AP sent TraceKit
`host version 1` and `configure` (type 4, `0x0040000000000000`) on endpoint `0x0a`, and
our ASC model logged both as "no protocol modelled".  Everything after that is
consequence: the display-off `set_device_power(0)` queues behind the guard, holding the
power object's recursive lock; `GetBlock` kind `0x41` (`GetDigitalOutMode`) blocks on
that lock inside `IOConnectCallMethod` selector 79; the render server's
`complete_display_state_transition` never releases `IOMFBServer+0x3b0`;
`+[CADisplay mainDisplay]` in SpringBoard never returns.

The protocol, from `_messageHandler` (`0xa7dec68`, `ubfx x1, x2, #0x34, #4`): type in
bits [55:52]; IOP→AP type 0 completes a flush and decrements the counter, types 1/2 set
`_stateIOP` to 2/3, type 3 sets it to `payload != 0`, type 4 clears it; `_configureGated`
then requires `_stateIOP == 1` (`"_stateIOP == TraceKitState::Configured"`).  The
responder in `darwin_asc.c` (`rtk_handle_tracekit`) answers configure/enable/disable
with `0x0030000000000001` and a flush with type 0.  First boot with it
(`UI_TRACEKIT1`): both DCP and ANS2 immediately followed our configure reply with a
type-2 disable that had never been sent before, i.e. the transition proceeded.
