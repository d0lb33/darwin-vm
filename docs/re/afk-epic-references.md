# AFK/EPIC protocol references

Scope: the AFK ring-buffer transport and EPIC message framing that ride on
top of an RTKit endpoint, as used by the DCP's `DCPEndpoint1`..`23`
(mailbox endpoints `0x20`-`0x36`, per `docs/re/dcp-bringup.md` and
`CLAUDE.md`). Goal: enough to write a QEMU device model that plays the
**firmware (IOP) side** of this protocol against XNU's real AP-side driver.

This does not cover the IOMFB protocol on endpoint `0x37` (`DCPEndpoint24`)
— that is a distinct RPC-with-callbacks framing (m1n1 calls it `dcpep`)
layered directly on RTKit, not on AFK/EPIC. See "What this does not cover".

## Where this plugs into `darwin_asc.c`

`darwin_asc.c` already implements the generic RTKit management endpoint
(hello, endpoint map, `START_EP`, power states) and exposes three hooks
(`qemu-sptm/include/xnu/darwin_asc.h:11-18`):

```c
void (*started)(void *opaque);                          // RTKit handshake done
void (*ep_start)(void *opaque, uint8_t ep, uint32_t flag); // AP started/stopped an endpoint
bool (*handle)(void *opaque, uint8_t ep, uint64_t msg);    // AP -> IOP message on a non-mgmt endpoint
```

A DCP AFK/EPIC model is a `DarwinASCOps` personality for the `dcp` node:
- `ep_start(opaque, ep, flag==2)` for `ep` in `0x20..0x36` is where the
  firmware-side AFK state machine for that endpoint begins (see "Ordered
  handshake" below) — this is XNU's `apple_rtkit_start_ep()` equivalent,
  confirmed at `afk.c:107` (`apple_rtkit_start_ep(ep->dcp->rtk, ep->endpoint);`
  called from `afk_start()`).
- `handle(opaque, ep, msg)` receives every AFK opcode the AP originates on
  that endpoint — `0x80`, `0xa1`, `0xa2`, `0xa3`, `0xc0` in the table below
  (the AP-→-firmware column), starting with `0x80` itself: `INIT` is not
  something `ep_start` delivers, it arrives as this endpoint's first
  `handle()` call.
- Sending is `darwin_asc_send(dev, ep, msg)` — the same function already
  used for RTKit management replies.

The 64-bit RTKit message payload (`msg0` in `darwin_asc.c`'s `ASCMsg`) is
where AFK opcodes live; the endpoint number in the *mailbox* frame (`ep` in
`darwin_asc_send`) is unrelated to the *channel* number inside EPIC frames
(§2) — one RTKit endpoint (e.g. `0x22`) carries many EPIC channels, one per
announced service.

## 1. AFK ring-buffer transport

### 1.1 Direction of every opcode (this is the part most likely to be
gotten backwards — see the task's caveat)

Established unambiguously from `AsahiLinux/linux`'s real AP-side driver:
opcodes are dispatched by direction because `afk_receive_message_worker()`
(`afk.c:681-724`) is *only* reached for messages the AP received (wired as
the RTKit `recv_message` callback via `dcp_recv_msg` → `afk_receive_message`,
`dcp.c:222-249`, `afk.c:726-741`), while `afk_send()` (`afk.c:51-54`) marks
every opcode the AP explicitly transmits.

| Opcode | Name (Linux `enum rbep_msg_type`, `afk.c:24-37`) | Direction | Sent when |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0x80` | `RBEP_INIT` | **AP → firmware** | Immediately after RTKit `START_EP` for this endpoint (`afk_start()`, `afk.c:102-115`: `apple_rtkit_start_ep()` then `afk_send(..., RBEP_INIT)`) |
| `0xa0` | `RBEP_INIT_ACK` | firmware → AP | Ack for `INIT`. Linux only `break`s on receipt (`afk.c:690-691`) — it does **not** gate anything, `afk_start()`'s completion is `RBEP_START_ACK` instead. Send it anyway; a real AP may assert on its absence. |
| `0x89` | `RBEP_GETBUF` | **firmware → AP** | Firmware requests a DMA buffer: `SIZE` (bits 31:16, units of 0x40 bytes) + `TAG` (bits 15:0, firmware-chosen correlation id) (`afk.c:41-42`, handled `afk.c:117-145`) |
| `0xa1` | `RBEP_GETBUF_ACK` | AP → firmware | AP allocates the buffer and replies with `DVA` (bits 47:0) = the buffer's IOP-visible (DART-mapped) address (`afk.c:43`, `afk.c:142-144`) |
| `0x8a` | `RBEP_INIT_TX` | **firmware → AP** | Firmware designates a sub-range of that buffer, by `OFFSET`(47:32)/`SIZE`(31:16)/`TAG`(15:0) in 0x40-byte units, as the ring **the AP transmits into** (`afk.c:45-47`, dispatched to `ep->txbfr` at `afk.c:705-706`) |
| `0x8b` | `RBEP_INIT_RX` | **firmware → AP** | Same fields, designates the ring **the AP receives from** (`ep->rxbfr`, `afk.c:709-710`) |
| `0xa3` | `RBEP_START` | AP → firmware | Sent automatically by the AP once *both* `txbfr` and `rxbfr` are validated (`afk_init_rxtx()`, `afk.c:195-196`) — not a separate driver call |
| `0x86` | `RBEP_START_ACK` | **firmware → AP** | Firmware acks `START`; this is what completes `afk_start()`'s wait (`afk.c:693-694`) — **this is the "endpoint is live" signal**, not `INIT_ACK` |
| `0xa2` | `RBEP_SEND` | AP → firmware | AP wrote a new EPIC frame into its TX ring; carries the new `WPTR` (bits 31:0) (`afk_send_epic()`, `afk.c:878-879`) |
| `0x85` | `RBEP_RECV` | **firmware → AP** | Firmware wrote a new EPIC frame into the AP's RX ring; same `WPTR` field. AP drains with `afk_recv()` in a loop until `rptr==wptr` (`afk.c:713-716`, `afk.c:587-679`) |
| `0xc0` | `RBEP_SHUTDOWN` | AP → firmware | `afk_shutdown()` sends this first (`afk.c:89-91`) |
| `0xc1` | `RBEP_SHUTDOWN_ACK` | **firmware → AP** | Completes the shutdown wait (`afk.c:697-698`) |

All fields are packed into the single 64-bit RTKit message; the opcode
itself is bits `[63:48]` (`RBEP_TYPE`, `afk.c:22`). `BLOCK_SHIFT = 6`
(`afk.c:39`): every size/offset/tag quantity above the low 16 bits is a
count of 64-byte blocks, not bytes.

Firmware-authored implication for our model: on `ep_start`, send `INIT`
is what the **AP** does — our firmware-side model instead *waits* for
`INIT` (`0x80`) as the first `handle()` callback, then drives `GETBUF` →
(wait for `GETBUF_ACK`) → `INIT_TX` + `INIT_RX` → (wait for `START`) →
send `START_ACK`. This is spelled out as an ordered sequence in §3.

**m1n1 cross-check**: `proxyclient/m1n1/fw/afk/rbep.py` defines the same
eleven opcodes with the same values (`rbep.py:13-51`) and the same field
layouts (`AFKEP_GetBuf.SIZE = 31,16` etc., `rbep.py:14-16`). Because m1n1's
`AFKRingBufEndpoint` is written generically enough to play either role (its
`start()` sends `0x80` *and* it has a handler for incoming `0x80` named
`Hello`, `rbep.py:186-187,206-211`), it does not by itself resolve
direction — the Linux driver above is what settles it.

### 1.2 Ring buffer header (per ring, at the base of the region `INIT_TX`/
`INIT_RX` designated)

```c
// afk.h:74-82
struct afk_ringbuffer_header {
    __le32 bufsz;      // usable ring size in bytes (excludes this header)
    u32 unk;
    u32 _pad1[14];      // pads bufsz+unk out to a 0x40-byte block
    __le32 rptr;
    u32 _pad2[15];      // pads rptr out to a 0x40-byte block
    __le32 wptr;
    u32 _pad3[15];      // pads wptr out to a 0x40-byte block
};                       // sizeof == 0xC0 (three 0x40 blocks)
```

Validated at `afk_init_rxtx()` (`afk.c:182-189`): the AP reads `bufsz` out
of the header itself and asserts `bufsz + sizeof(header) == SIZE` from the
`INIT_TX`/`INIT_RX` message — i.e. **the firmware must have already written
a correct `bufsz` into the header before sending `INIT_TX`/`INIT_RX`**, and
the region named by `OFFSET`/`SIZE` is `header(0xC0 bytes) + payload(bufsz
bytes)`. `rptr`/`wptr` are byte offsets into the *payload* area (i.e.
relative to `buf = hdr + 1`, `afk.c:191` / `afk.h:155-158`), not absolute
offsets into the buffer.

m1n1's `AFKRingBuf.__init__` (`rbep.py:85-98`) derives the same 0x40 block
size generically by reading the first two u32s and dividing
`(size - bufsz) / 3` — algebraically identical to the fixed `0xC0` above
since `3 * 0x40 == 0xC0`, just written defensively instead of as a literal
constant.

Both rings (AP's TX and AP's RX) get this same header shape; they are two
independent regions inside the one buffer the firmware requested via
`GETBUF`, at whatever `OFFSET`s the firmware chose in its two `INIT_TX`/
`INIT_RX` messages (typically contiguous, but nothing enforces that — the
model should honor whatever offsets/sizes it advertises).

### 1.3 Ring queue entry (one per EPIC frame, written at the ring's current
`wptr`/read at `rptr`)

```c
// afk.h:84-91
struct afk_qe {
#define QE_MAGIC 0x20504f49   // little-endian bytes 49 4f 50 20 = "IOP "
    __le32 magic;
    __le32 size;      // bytes of EPIC payload that follow (epic_hdr + epic_sub_hdr + payload)
    __le32 channel;   // EPIC channel number (see §2)
    __le32 type;      // EPICType: NOTIFY=0, COMMAND=3, REPLY=4, NOTIFY_ACK=8
    u8 data[];         // epic_hdr, then epic_sub_hdr, then payload — see §2
};
```

`QE_MAGIC` is literally the ASCII bytes `"IOP "` (space-padded); m1n1
additionally accepts `"AOP "` for the AOP coprocessor's own AFK rings
(`rbep.py:130,135` — `assert magic in [b"IOP ", b"AOP "]`), so the magic is
per-coprocessor, not fixed protocol-wide. For DCP it is always `"IOP "`.

**Wrap-around**: if a queue entry would run past the end of the ring, the
writer places a *bare* `afk_qe` header (magic+size only, no payload
following — `size` still describes the real payload that lives at offset 0)
at the current `wptr`, then writes the real header+payload starting at
offset 0 of the ring. The reader detects this by checking
`rptr + size + sizeof(hdr) > bufsz` after reading a header; if so it
re-reads the header from offset 0 and continues from there. Read side:
`afk_recv()` `afk.c:606-653`. Write side: `afk_send_epic()` `afk.c:781-835`
(the `hdr2`/`wptr = sizeof(*hdr)` case). Every entry (real or wrap-marker)
starts on a `1 << BLOCK_SHIFT` (0x40-byte) aligned offset
(`afk.c:658,872-874`), and `wptr`/`rptr` wrap to `0` exactly at `bufsz`,
never left equal to `bufsz`.

Ring-full is detected purely by comparing prospective new `wptr` against
the peer's `rptr` (no fixed low-water-mark reservation beyond "must fit a
bare header" in the wrap case) — see the three `-ENOMEM` cases in
`afk_send_epic()`, `afk.c:787-829`.

**Ordering/memory-barrier note** (relevant only if the model's ring reads
race a vCPU rather than a real DMA-coherent link): Linux issues `dma_rmb()`
before reading a queue entry and `dma_mb()` before publishing the new
`rptr` (`afk.c:613,664`). Our model reads/writes guest memory synchronously
under the BQL, so this has no direct QEMU-side consequence, but it
confirms the wire contract: **write the payload, then the queue entry
header, then update the shared `wptr`, then send the RTKit notify message**
— in that order — matching `afk_send_epic()`'s sequence exactly.

## 2. EPIC framing (inside `afk_qe.data`)

### 2.1 Two-level header

```c
// afk.h:93-99
struct epic_hdr {
    u8 version;        // observed constant 2 (afk.c:851: ehdr->version = 2;)
    __le16 seq;         // per-endpoint sequence counter, increments every send (ep->qe_seq)
    u8 _pad;
    __le32 unk;          // always 0 on send
    __le64 timestamp;    // always 0 on send (afk.c:853)
} __attribute__((packed));   // 16 bytes

// afk.h:101-110
struct epic_sub_hdr {
    __le32 length;       // payload length in bytes, following this sub-header
    u8 version;          // observed constant 4 (afk.c:859: eshdr->version = 4;)
    u8 category;         // EPICCategory
    __le16 type;          // EPICSubtype (or an EPICType.NOTIFY_ACK-style command code — same field, meaning is per-category)
    __le64 timestamp;     // always 0 on send
    __le16 tag;            // correlation id for command/reply matching (see §2.4)
    __le16 unk;             // always 0 on send
    __le32 inline_len;      // payload_len-4 if category==REPLY, else 0 (afk.c:864-867)
} __attribute__((packed));   // 24 bytes
```

Wire order inside `afk_qe.data`: `epic_hdr` (16B) then `epic_sub_hdr` (24B)
then the payload (`epic_sub_hdr.length` bytes) — built in that order at
`afk_send_epic()` `afk.c:849-870`, parsed in that order at
`afk_recv_handle()` `afk.c:511-527`.

```c
// afk.h:133-151
enum epic_type {           // afk_qe.type AND epic_hdr's implicit "outer" type
    EPIC_TYPE_NOTIFY = 0,
    EPIC_TYPE_COMMAND = 3,
    EPIC_TYPE_REPLY = 4,
    EPIC_TYPE_NOTIFY_ACK = 8,
};
enum epic_category {        // epic_sub_hdr.category
    EPIC_CAT_REPORT = 0x00,
    EPIC_CAT_NOTIFY = 0x10,
    EPIC_CAT_REPLY = 0x20,
    EPIC_CAT_COMMAND = 0x30,
};
enum epic_subtype {          // epic_sub_hdr.type, when category==REPORT
    EPIC_SUBTYPE_ANNOUNCE = 0x30,
    EPIC_SUBTYPE_TEARDOWN = 0x32,
    EPIC_SUBTYPE_STD_SERVICE = 0xc0,
};
```

**m1n1 cross-check and a version wrinkle**: m1n1's `epic.py` defines the
same fields but as a `construct` `EPICSubHeader` with `version=4` (the
default) *and* an alternate `EPICSubHeaderV2` with `version=2` that drops
the 64-bit `timestamp` for a `pad`/`Int64ul` in a different position
(`epic.py:46-66`), selectable via `send_epic(..., version=2|4)`
(`epic.py:427-432`). m1n1 also documents two more subtypes Linux's smaller
driver never emits: `RETCODE_WITH_PAYLOAD = 0xa0` and `RETCODE = 0x84`,
`STRING = 0x8a` (`epic.py:27-34`) — plausible on replies from services
Linux doesn't implement (e.g. richer macOS-only services). **Treat the v4
sub-header as current** (Linux, which tracks the newer of the two firmware
generations it supports, always builds v4) and the v2 layout as a
legacy/older-firmware fallback — flag explicitly as version-sensitive,
since neither reference targets iOS 27 firmware (see "Version-sensitive").

### 2.2 Service announce: how a channel gets a name (the `EPICName`
mechanism)

A **channel** is a firmware-chosen `u32` (independent from the RTKit
endpoint number) identifying one logical service multiplexed over the
shared ring. Before any command/reply traffic, the firmware announces a new
channel with a `REPORT`/`ANNOUNCE` frame:

- `afk_qe.type = EPIC_TYPE_NOTIFY`, `epic_sub_hdr.category = EPIC_CAT_REPORT`,
  `epic_sub_hdr.type = EPIC_SUBTYPE_ANNOUNCE (0x30)`.
- Payload = a fixed 32-byte NUL-terminated/padded name string, followed by
  an optional serialized property dictionary (`afk_recv_handle_init()`,
  `afk.c:241-325`; `props = payload + 32`, `props_size = payload_size - 32`).

The property dictionary, when present, is parsed by `parse_epic_service_init()`
(`parser.c:647-707`) and can carry three keys:

| Key | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `EPICName` | string | Stable machine-readable service id — **this is literally the string XNU's `AFKEndpointInterface` kext matches via `IOPropertyMatch`**, e.g. `dcpdptx-port-epic` (`dptxep.c:574`, confirmed: `if (strcmp(name, "dcpdptx-port-epic")) return;`), `dcpav-service-epic` / `dcpdp-service-epic` (`epic/dpavservep.c:23,197,203`) |
| `EPICProviderClass` | string | The IOKit driver class name expected to bind, e.g. `AppleDCPDPTXRemotePort`, `DCPAVSimpleVideoInterface`, `DCPAVAudioInterface` (`dptxep.c:601-606`, `av.c:280,285`) |
| `EPICUnit` | signed 64-bit int | Instance index for multi-instance services (e.g. DP port 0 vs 1, `dptxep.c:568-582`) |

Confirms and extends `docs/re/dcp-bringup.md`'s note that "Sub-services
attach by `EPICName`": the wire mechanism is this announce report, and the
task's requested names (`dcpav-controller-epic`, `dcpav-device-epic`,
`dcpav-service-epic`, `dcpav-video-interface-epic`, `dcpav-power-epic`,
`dcpdptx-port-epic`) are `EPICName` property values inside this dictionary,
not the raw 32-byte name field (which Linux's own services instead set to
things like `"system"`, `"DCPAVSimpleVideoInterface"` — see
`systemep.c:105-111`, `av.c:278-289`). **The Linux driver itself matches
services by `EPICProviderClass` by default** (`afk_recv_handle_init()`,
`afk.c:291-299`: `service_name = epic_class`) and only by `EPICName`
directly for endpoints that opt in via `ep->match_epic_name = true`
(`afk.h:187`; set for `dpavservep` at `epic/dpavservep.c:221`). XNU's own
matching key is `EPICName` per the kernelcache `IOKitPersonalities` evidence
already in `docs/re/dcp-bringup.md` — **our model must populate all three
properties** (`EPICName`, `EPICProviderClass`, `EPICUnit`) in every announce
so it satisfies whichever key a given kext's personality actually matches
on; we do not have the kext source, only the matched property name.

**Property dictionary wire format** (needed to actually build this
payload): it is Apple's own tag/length/value serialization, *not* XML
plist or bplist. Parser at `parser.c:18-287`:

```c
#define DCP_PARSE_HEADER 0xd3          // parser.c:18 — leading LE u32, must equal exactly 0xd3

enum dcp_parse_type {                   // parser.c:20-26
    DCP_TYPE_DICTIONARY = 1,
    DCP_TYPE_ARRAY = 2,
    DCP_TYPE_INT64 = 4,
    DCP_TYPE_STRING = 9,
    DCP_TYPE_BLOB = 10,
    DCP_TYPE_BOOL = 11,
};

struct dcp_parse_tag {                  // parser.c:28-34, 4 bytes, 32-bit-aligned before every tag
    unsigned int size : 24;              // element count (dict/array) or byte length (string/blob) or bool value
    enum dcp_parse_type type : 5;
    unsigned int padding : 2;             // must be 0
    bool last : 1;
} __packed;
```

Blob = `u32 header(==0xd3)` then one root tag+value (typically a
`DCP_TYPE_DICTIONARY` whose values are `key(STRING), value` pairs — see
`dcp_parse_foreach_in_dict` usage throughout `parser.c`). Strings and blobs
are followed by their raw bytes, 4-byte realigned before the next tag
(`parse_tag()`, `parser.c:52-60`: `ctx->pos = round_up(ctx->pos, 4)`).
`DCP_TYPE_INT64` values are a raw 8-byte little-endian `s64` immediately
after the tag (`parser.c:181-198`). This is the same format m1n1 calls
`OSSerialize()` in its `construct` grammar (`epic.py:71`,
`EPICAnnounce.props`) — Linux's version above is the concrete byte-level
spec.

### 2.3 Standard service call/reply (the RPC layer most services use)

Once a channel exists, the common pattern (`EPIC_SUBTYPE_STD_SERVICE =
0xc0`) is a `group`/`command` RPC:

```c
// afk.h:112-120 — carried as the COMMAND payload (category=COMMAND, type=STD_SERVICE)
struct epic_cmd {
    __le32 retcode;
    __le64 rxbuf;    // AP-allocated DMA buffer, IOP writes its reply here
    __le64 txbuf;    // AP-allocated DMA buffer, holds the request
    __le32 rxlen;
    __le32 txlen;
    u8 rxcookie;
    u8 txcookie;
} __attribute__((packed));

// afk.h:122-130 — the actual request/response layout inside txbuf/rxbuf
struct epic_service_call {
    u8 _pad0[2];
    __le16 group;
    __le32 command;
    __le32 data_len;
#define EPIC_SERVICE_CALL_MAGIC 0x69706378   // opaque magic constant, LE bytes 78 63 70 69 — see afk.c:1009
    __le32 magic;
    u8 _pad1[48];
} __attribute__((packed));   // exactly 64 bytes (static_assert at afk.h:131)
```

Call flow (`afk_send_command()` `afk.c:887-985`, `afk_service_call()`
`afk.c:987-1039`): AP allocates `rxbuf`/`txbuf`, sends `epic_cmd` as a
`COMMAND`/`STD_SERVICE` frame with a unique `tag` (`(cmd_tag<<8)|slot_idx`,
`afk.c:927-931`), firmware processes it and sends back a `REPLY` frame on
the same channel whose payload is another `epic_cmd` with `retcode` filled
in (`afk_recv_handle_reply()`, `afk.c:357-430` — matched by `tag`, not by
sequence). The `EPICName`/service-specific request bytes live *inside*
`txbuf`/`rxbuf`, wrapped in `epic_service_call` when using the
group/command convention (not all services use it — `system`'s
`setProperty` call, opcode `0x43`, sends a raw serialized dict directly as
the command payload with no `epic_service_call` wrapper — see
`systemep.c:18-24,36-39` and `AFKSystemService.setProperty` in
`epic.py:287-294`).

Firmware can also push unsolicited data on an existing channel as a
`NOTIFY`/`REPORT` frame (`afk_recv_handle_std_service()`'s `REPORT` branch,
`afk.c:497-502`) — the AP does not reply to these, it just invokes
`ops->report()`.

### 2.4 Teardown

Firmware closes a channel with `REPORT`/`TEARDOWN` (subtype `0x32`), no
payload beyond the header (`afk_recv_handle_teardown()`, `afk.c:327-355`).
The AP does not ack this.

## 3. Ordered startup handshake (firmware's actions, in order)

Combining §1.1 direction and §2.2, here is the full sequence for one AFK
endpoint (e.g. `0x22`) from RTKit's perspective through the first service
being live. **FW = our model, AP = XNU's real driver.**

1. **AP → FW**, RTKit management: `START_EP` for this endpoint
   (already implemented — `darwin_asc.c`'s `MGMT_START_EP` handler fires
   `DarwinASCOps.ep_start(opaque, ep, flag=2)`). *Not an AFK message.*
2. **AP → FW**: `RBEP_INIT` (`0x80`) — this endpoint's mailbox is live,
   bring up AFK (`afk.c:107-108`).
3. **FW → AP**: `RBEP_INIT_ACK` (`0xa0`) — no payload beyond the opcode.
4. **FW → AP**: `RBEP_GETBUF` (`0x89`) — `SIZE` (blocks of 0x40) for a
   buffer large enough to hold both rings' headers+payloads, `TAG` chosen
   by firmware (any value, echoed back later) (`afk.c:119-123`).
5. **AP → FW**: `RBEP_GETBUF_ACK` (`0xa1`) — `DVA`, the buffer's
   IOP-visible address (`afk.c:142-144`).
6. Firmware writes `bufsz` (and zeroes `rptr`/`wptr`) into the header of
   each of the two sub-ranges it is about to designate (§1.2) — a local
   step, no wire traffic.
7. **FW → AP**: `RBEP_INIT_TX` (`0x8a`) — `OFFSET`/`SIZE`/`TAG` (`TAG` must
   equal step 4's tag) for the ring the AP will write into
   (`afk.c:150-159,705-706`).
8. **FW → AP**: `RBEP_INIT_RX` (`0x8b`) — same, for the ring the AP will
   read from (`afk.c:709-710`).
   *(Order of 7 vs. 8 is not enforced by the AP — `afk_init_rxtx()` fires
   the same validation regardless of which arrives first, and only sends
   `START` once both are ready — `afk.c:195-196` — so a model may send
   them in either order.)*
9. **AP → FW**: `RBEP_START` (`0xa3`) — sent automatically once step 7 and
   8 both validated (`afk.c:195-196`).
10. **FW → AP**: `RBEP_START_ACK` (`0x86`) — **this is the point the AP
    considers the endpoint live** (`afk_start()`'s `wait_for_completion`
    unblocks here, `afk.c:110-114`).
11. For each service the firmware wants to expose on this endpoint: **FW →
    AP**, a `REPORT`/`ANNOUNCE` EPIC frame on a fresh channel number, with
    the 32-byte name + `EPICName`/`EPICProviderClass`/`EPICUnit` property
    dict (§2.2), delivered via a ring write + `RBEP_RECV` (`0x85`)
    notification (§1.1's data-path row). This is what XNU's kext matching
    reacts to and is presumably what happens once per logical sub-driver
    (`dcpav-controller-epic`, `dcpav-device-epic`, etc. — six to twenty-odd
    of these per DCP AFK endpoint based on `DCPEndpoint1..23`'s existence).
12. Steady state: either side notifies the other of new ring data with
    `RBEP_SEND` (`0xa2`, AP→FW) / `RBEP_RECV` (`0x85`, FW→AP); command/reply
    traffic per §2.3 happens per-channel from here on.
13. Teardown (if ever needed): **AP → FW** `RBEP_SHUTDOWN` (`0xc0`), **FW →
    AP** `RBEP_SHUTDOWN_ACK` (`0xc1`) (`afk.c:89-100`).

`dcp_start()` (`dcp.c:503-570`) shows the AP brings AFK endpoints up in a
fixed order relative to each other — `systemep` first
(`systemep_init()`, unconditional), then optionally `dpavservep`
(gated on `unstable_edid && !dcp_has_panel(dcp)` — likely irrelevant to a
full emulation target), then `ibootep`/`dptxep` (gated on
`fw_compat >= DCP_FIRMWARE_V_13_5`), then IOMFB (`iomfb_start_rtkit()`,
not AFK), then optionally `avep`. Whether the real DCP firmware's *own*
internal ordering of `RBEP_INIT` (step 2, per endpoint) across the
different mailbox endpoints matches this AP-side call order is not
something this Linux driver can show — it is the AP calling into RTKit's
`apple_rtkit_start_ep()` per endpoint from its own probe routine, and each
`START_EP` independently triggers the sequence above. **Our model does not
need to replicate cross-endpoint ordering** since each endpoint's handshake
is self-contained; it only needs to answer whichever `START_EP`s XNU issues
and in whichever order.

---

## 4. Endpoint-number correlation (informational, not confirmed for t8140)

Linux's endpoint numbers (`dcp-internal.h:36-46`) are M1/M2-era (macOS
12.3-13.5). They line up suspiciously well with the `DCPEndpoint<N>`
numbering already reverse-engineered from the real iOS 27 kernelcache in
`docs/re/dcp-bringup.md` (`N = endpoint - 0x1f`):

| Endpoint | Linux name (M-series, `dcp-internal.h`) | Our `DCPEndpoint<N>` (t8140, from kernelcache) |
|---|---|---|
| `0x20` | `SYSTEM_ENDPOINT` | `DCPEndpoint1` |
| `0x21` | `TEST_ENDPOINT` | `DCPEndpoint2` |
| `0x22` | `DCP_EXPERT_ENDPOINT` | `DCPEndpoint3` |
| `0x23` | `DISP0_ENDPOINT` | `DCPEndpoint4` |
| `0x28` | `DPAVSERV_ENDPOINT` | `DCPEndpoint9` |
| `0x29` | `AV_ENDPOINT` | `DCPEndpoint10` |
| `0x2a` | `DPTX_ENDPOINT` | `DCPEndpoint11` |
| `0x2b` | `HDCP_ENDPOINT` | `DCPEndpoint12` |
| `0x2d` | `REMOTE_ALLOC_ENDPOINT` | `DCPEndpoint14` |
| `0x37` | `IOMFB_ENDPOINT` (not AFK) | `DCPEndpoint24` (not AFK, per `dcp-bringup.md`) |

**This is a correlation across a ~4-year, several-major-version gap, not a
citation of an iOS 27 source — do not treat the specific endpoint↔service
mapping as confirmed.** The generic RTKit endpoint-map mechanism means the
AP always discovers which endpoints exist from the firmware's own map
message (already handled in `darwin_asc.c`), so a model does not strictly
need to guess which numeric endpoint carries which service — but knowing
plausible candidates is useful for deciding which `EPICName` values to
announce on which endpoint first while bringing the display up.

---

## 5. Version-sensitive — flagged explicitly per the task's caveat

Every item below is a place where iOS 27 / A18 DCP firmware could plausibly
differ from what's cited, because both references target macOS-era
firmware roughly 3-4 years and several major versions older:

- **EPIC sub-header version**: Linux always builds `version = 4`
  (`afk.c:859`) against firmware up to `DCP_FIRMWARE_V_13_5`
  (`dcp-internal.h:29-33`). m1n1 additionally knows a `version = 2` layout
  (`epic.py:57-66`) with a different field order, presumably for even
  older (M1-launch-era) firmware. iOS 27's DCP could use `4`, a newer `5`+
  we have no reference for, or something else — **not directly confirmed
  for our target**.
- **`EPICSubtype` completeness**: Linux's driver only emits/expects
  `ANNOUNCE`, `TEARDOWN`, `STD_SERVICE` (`afk.h:147-151`); m1n1 additionally
  lists `RETCODE_WITH_PAYLOAD (0xa0)`, `RETCODE (0x84)`, `STRING (0x8a)`
  (`epic.py:27-34`) seen on services Linux doesn't implement. The full
  subtype space for iOS 27's DCP-specific services (`dcpav-controller-epic`
  etc., none of which Linux implements) is **unknown** — only the generic
  framing (§2.1) and the announce/std-service mechanics (§2.2-2.3) are
  well-attested.
- **Ring header padding layout** (`afk_ringbuffer_header`'s exact
  `_pad1`/`_pad2`/`_pad3` sizes): derived from Linux's `static_assert`-free
  struct, cross-checked only algebraically against m1n1's generic
  block-size derivation (§1.2) — both agree the *total* is `0xC0` bytes
  split into three `0x40` blocks, but neither is a first-party Apple
  header; the individual field offsets (`bufsz` at `+0`, `rptr` at `+0x40`,
  `wptr` at `+0x80`) are what to treat as load-bearing, not the padding.
- **`epic_service_call`'s 48-byte trailing padding**: unexplored — Linux
  never reads it, always zero-fills on send (`afk_service_call()`,
  `afk.c:1003-1010` uses `kzalloc`). Could carry meaning on newer firmware.
- **Endpoint↔service numeric mapping**: see §4 — explicitly a correlation,
  not a citation.
- **`EPICName` matching being the primary key**: confirmed only indirectly
  — Linux's own driver prefers `EPICProviderClass` (§2.2) and only uses
  `EPICName` for one endpoint (`dpavservep`, opted in via
  `match_epic_name`). That XNU instead keys on `EPICName` broadly is a
  fact from *this repo's own* kernelcache research
  (`docs/re/dcp-bringup.md`), not from either reference — the two are
  independent, consistent lines of evidence, but neither reference proves
  the other's usage pattern.
- **RTKit `START_EP` flag encoding**: Linux's `APPLE_RTKit_MGMT_STARTEP_FLAG`
  is `BIT_ULL(1)` (`drivers/soc/apple/rtkit.c:51`, mainline Linux, commit
  `8931299`) vs. our `darwin_asc.c`'s `MGMT_STARTEP_FLAG(m) ((m) & 3)`
  checked against `== 2` — consistent (bit 1 set), noted only because it's
  a place the two disagreed in *representation* though not in *value*, and
  is out of scope for this doc (RTKit management is already implemented
  and working per `CLAUDE.md`).

## What this does not cover

- **The IOMFB protocol** (endpoint `0x37`/`DCPEndpoint24`) — a separate,
  non-AFK RPC-with-callback framing (`iomfb.c`, `iomfb_v12_3.c`,
  `iomfb_v13_3.c` in the Asahi tree; `dcpep.py`/`ipc.py`/`manager.py` in
  m1n1). This is the protocol that actually carries display mode setting,
  framebuffer swap, etc. — AFK/EPIC only gets the *sub-services* (audio,
  DP-alt-mode ports, EDID/AV service, system logging) up. Getting a picture
  out still needs this layer separately reverse-engineered/modelled.
- **What payload each specific `dcpav-*`/`dcpdptx-*` service expects for
  its `STD_SERVICE` group/command calls.** Linux implements only a handful
  of DCP's real services (`system`, `powerlog-service`, `dcpav-service-epic`,
  `dcpdp-service-epic`, `AppleDCPDPTXRemotePort`, `DCPAVSimpleVideoInterface`,
  `DCPAVAudioInterface`) — none of the names in the task's list
  (`dcpav-controller-epic`, `dcpav-device-epic`,
  `dcpav-video-interface-epic`, `dcpav-power-epic`) appear anywhere in
  either reference. Their `group`/`command` numbers, argument structs, and
  even whether they're `EPICName` or `EPICProviderClass` values are
  **entirely unknown from these sources** — that's kext disassembly work
  (`DCPAVFamilyProxy`/`AppleDCPDPTXProxy`, per `docs/re/dcp-bringup.md`),
  not something either reference body reaches.
- **How many channels/services a real DCP firmware announces on endpoint
  bring-up, or in what order** — neither reference captures a live
  announce trace; §3 step 11 is structurally correct (this is how any
  announce happens) but not populated with a real sequence.
- **QEMU-side prior art** — confirmed none exists; QEMUAppleSilicon solves
  the display problem by modelling display-pipe hardware registers
  directly and never brings up a DCP coprocessor at all, which is a
  materially different strategy than this project's goal of getting XNU's
  unmodified `AppleCLCD2`/`IOMFB`/`DCPEndpointV2` stack to run against an
  impersonated firmware. There is no existing "pretend to be the DCP over
  RTKit" QEMU model to diff against.
- **AOP/other coprocessors' use of AFK** — m1n1 hints AOP (audio) also
  speaks AFK (the `"AOP "` ring magic, `EPICServiceAnnounce`'s different
  20-byte name field in `epic.py:75-83`), suggesting the announce payload
  shape isn't perfectly uniform across coprocessors. Irrelevant to DCP
  specifically but a reminder that "AFK" is a shared library, not a
  DCP-only protocol, and other coprocessors' variations shouldn't be
  assumed to apply here.

## iOS 27 corrections, derived live (2026-09-02)

Two fields this document and `darwin_epic.c` had wrong, both established by
instrumenting a boot rather than from the M1-era references.

### The message header's byte 0 is a sequence counter, not flags

`darwin_epic.c` documents it as flags, "bit 0 means a 0x18-byte extra block
follows". Across one boot the AP sent `0x0, 0x1, 0x2 ... 0xf` on successive
frames — a clean monotonic counter. Whatever the flag reading was based on, the
AP is using this byte as a sequence/tag. Echoing it in replies is harmless and
probably right; it is not on its own what makes a reply acceptable (tested).

### The command body's u32 at +4 is a length inbound and a return code outbound

The standard-service (`0xc0`) body starts with an 8-byte header. Byte 1 is the
command id the AP matches replies against (`0xfffffff008b8eca8`,
`ubfx w1, w26, #8, #8`). The u32 at +4 is **not** a symmetric field:

- **Inbound** it is the payload length. Across three commands in one boot it
  was always `body_len - 8`: `0x60`/`0x68`, `0x50`/`0x58`, `0x90`/`0x98`.
- **Outbound** the AP reads the same offset as a return code.

Echoing it back made `DCPAVRemoteSACControllerProxy` — interface 8, whose
command carried `arg 0x50` — report exactly:

```
IOReturn DCPAVRemoteSACControllerProxy::bootCompleteGated() error: ret = 0x50 (UNDEFINED)
```

The value matching the request length, on the one interface whose request
carried that length, is what identified the field. Zeroing it clears the error.

### Sequence, once replies are answered at all

With no reply the AP sends one `REPORT OPEN` and one command and stops. With a
reply it opens every announced interface and keeps going:

```
REPORT OPEN   iface 1..10
REPORT CLOSE  iface 6          (dcpav-audio-interface-epic, declined)
COMMAND 0xc0  iface 1 (body 0x68), 8 (0x58), 10 (0x98)
```

13 OPEN reports and 1 CLOSE in a 150-second boot.
